	  <h3>football</h3>
	  <p>im going to talk about football because football is more than a sport to me it can teach you lifelong lessons that you will use throughout your life its a competitive game there is no greater feeling after knowing you did good that day
	  no matter if it was practice or a game and there is so much more to do with football you learn team building you learn communication skills you learn how to control you emotions but the unique thing about football is that everybody has
	  something to prove for either your coach your family or friends or maybe yourself </p>
	  <ul>
	  <li>team bonding</li></ul> <li>life skills</li> <li>control emotions</li>
